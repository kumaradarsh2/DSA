# Data Structures and Algorithms Study Journey

This repository documents my ongoing journey of learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms. I've created this as a way to track my progress, store implementation examples, and build a personal reference guide.

## Purpose

- Track my DSA learning progress
- Store clean, commented implementations
- Build a reference guide for future review
- Maintain consistency through regular commits

## Topics Covered

### Arrays
- Basic array operations and manipulations

### Binary Search
