# Data Structures and Algorithms in C++

This repository documents my ongoing journey of learning and practicing Data Structures and Algorithms using C++. It serves as a personal log of my progress, a collection of solutions to various problems, and a quick reference guide for future review.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topic. Each top-level directory corresponds to a major data structure, an algorithmic concept, or a C++ feature. Inside each directory, you'll find C++ source files (`.cpp`) that implement the concepts or solve specific problems related to that topic.

## Topics Covered So Far

Here's a summary of the concepts and problem patterns I've worked on:

### Core Data Structures
* **Arrays**: Basic operations, rotations, and classic problems.
* **2D Arrays (Matrices)**: Traversal (Spiral, Wave), rotation, binary search, and other matrix manipulations.
* **Strings**: *(Actively working on this)*
    * Basic manipulations and checks (Palindrome, Reversal).
    * Problem-solving with strings (Sorting, IP Defanging).
    * Introduction to Sliding Window technique.

### Algorithmic Techniques
* **Binary Search**: Standard implementation and solutions to many popular interview problems on sorted arrays.
* **Two Pointers**: Solving problems efficiently by using two pointers to traverse data structures.
* **Prefix Sum**: Technique for solving subarray sum and related problems.
* **Sorting**: Implementation of basic sorting algorithms like Insertion Sort.
* **Mathematical Algorithms**: Basic number theory concepts like GCD.

### C++ Standard Template Library (STL)
* Hands-on practice with core STL containers and utilities:
    * `std::vector`
    * `std::list`
    * `std::pair`
    * `std::map`
    * `std::set`
    * `std::unordered_map`
    * `std::unordered_set`

## What's Next?
My immediate focus is on deepening my understanding of **Strings** and the **Sliding Window** technique. After that, I plan to tackle:
-   Pointers and Memory Management
-   Recursion (Big Boss)
-   Object Oriented Programming in c++ (OOP)

### Phase 2 Starts here
-   Linked Lists
-   Stacks & Queues
-   Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
-   Heaps (Priority Queues)
-   Graphs
-   Dynamic Programming
